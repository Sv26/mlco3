Deciphering Crypto Trends: A Comprehensive Guide
This repository contains my solution for the "Decipher Crypto Trends" challenge hosted on the Desights platform. The goal of this challenge was to analyze Google Trends data and apply predictive modeling techniques to understand cryptocurrency market dynamics.

Understanding the Challenge
The challenge requires extracting valuable insights on the interplay between Google Trends metrics and the valuation of crypto tokens. This includes integrating supplementary datasets, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and leveraging advanced machine learning methodologies.

The ultimate goal is to discern correlations, forecast trends, and situate contemporary market phenomena within the framework of historical cycles.

Solution Approach
This solution utilizes the following steps:

Data Acquisition: Gathering Google Trends data and any supplementary datasets relevant to the analysis.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, and potentially feature engineering to create new variables for better model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the data through visualizations, identifying patterns, and discovering key relationships between variables.
Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning model, considering the nature of the data and the desired prediction task.
Model Training and Evaluation: Training the model with the preprocessed data and evaluating its performance using relevant metrics.
Interpretation and Visualization: Interpreting the model's findings, visualizing key trends, and presenting insights into the relationship between Google Trends and crypto market dynamics.
